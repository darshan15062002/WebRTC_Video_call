What is WebSocket?
WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channel

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.

The HTTP 1.1 (only) "Upgrade" header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a WebSocket.
